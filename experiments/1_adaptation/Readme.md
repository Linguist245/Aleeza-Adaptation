# Adaptation experiment

We have 4 conditions (probably-biased and bare-biased) with a male and female speaker.

## Participants

MTurk participants with US IP addresses and >95% approval. For each condition, we run 80 participants. Within each condition, 20 participants see the male speaker and 20 participants see the female speaker.


## Exclusion criteria

We exclude participants who provide the wrong answer to more than 25% of the catch trials (i.e., participants who provide the correct answer to less than 12/15 catch trials.)

## Procedure

See the following web-based experiments: 

- probably-biased condition, female speaker:
  https://aleezayu.github.io/Aleeza-Adaptation/experiments/1_adaptation/experiment/experiment-cond-0.html
- bare-biased condition, female speaker:
  https://aleezayu.github.io/Aleeza-Adaptation/experiments/1_adaptation/experiment/experiment-cond-1.html
- probably-biased condition, male speaker:
  https://aleezayu.github.io/Aleeza-Adaptation/experiments/1_adaptation/experiment/experiment-cond-2.html
- bare-biased condition, male speaker:
  https://aleezayu.github.io/Aleeza-Adaptation/experiments/1_adaptation/experiment/experiment-cond-3.html

## Predictions
We predict that the probably ratings will be significantly higher in the probably-biased condition than in the bare-based condition and the pre-test condition.
